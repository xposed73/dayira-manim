# Fraction Circle with Effects (Manim)

This repository contains a Python code to generate a fraction circle with multiple slices using [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/). The circle can be animated with several effects like explosion, indication, and dimming for remaining slices. This project is designed to demonstrate the use of Manimâ€™s animation capabilities and the creation of dynamic visual effects for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Create a Circle**: Generates a fraction circle divided into slices.
- **Exploding Slices**: Animates the slices exploding outward from the center.
- **Indicating Slices**: Allows highlighting specific slices with color changes and scaling.
- **Dimming Effects**: Dims the remaining slices after the indication animation.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/) installed. You can install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install manim
