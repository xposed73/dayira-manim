# Dayira - Fraction Circle with Effects (Manim)

## Project Overview

**Dayira** is a Python-based project that utilizes the Manim library to create animated fraction circles. The circle is divided into multiple slices, and various effects such as explosions, indications, and dimming can be applied to enhance the animation.

This project is designed to demonstrate the power of Manim for generating complex mathematical visualizations with interactive effects.

## Features

- **Fraction Circle Creation**: Generates a circle divided into multiple slices (sectors).
- **Explosion Effect**: Animates the slices exploding outward from the center.
- **Indication Effect**: Allows highlighting specific slices with color changes and scaling.
- **Dimming Effect**: Dims the non-indicated slices to emphasize the indicated ones.

## Installation

Before running the code, you need to install the required dependencies. This project uses **Manim** and **numpy**.

### Install Manim

Manim is a community-maintained Python library for mathematical animations. To install Manim Community v0.19.0, follow the instructions from the official documentation:
